About ten years ago when I was an undergraduate in college, I was working as an intern at my University’s Museum of Natural History. One day while working at the cash register in the gift shop, I saw an elderly couple come in with a little girl in a wheelchair. 
大约十年前，我在学院读本科的时候，当时我在本校的自然历史博物馆实习。一天，当我在礼品店收银台前工作时，我看见一对老夫妻推着一个坐着轮椅的小女孩进来了。
As I looked closer at this girl, I saw that she was a kind of perched on her chair. I then realized she had no arms or legs, just a head, neck and torso. She was wearing a little white dress with red polka dots. 
我细看这位小女孩时，我发现她是靠轮椅生存的人。当时我意识到她没有胳膊和腿，仅有头、脖子和躯干。她穿着一件小巧的带红色圆点图案的白裙子。
As the couple wheeled her up to me I was looking down at the register. I turned my head toward the girl and gave her a wink. As I took the money from her grandparents, I looked back at the girl, who was giving me the cutest, largest smile I have ever seen. 
当那对夫妇推着她走向我时，我正低头看着记录器。我抬头望着小女孩，对她眨了眨眼。当我从她祖父母手中接过钱时，我回头望了一下她，她正朝我微笑，那是我见过最可爱最灿烂的笑容。
All of a sudden her handicap was gone and all I saw was this beautiful girl, whose smile just melted me and almost instantly gave me a completely new sense of what life is all about. She took me from a poor, unhappy college student and brought me into her world; a world of smiles, love and warmth. 突然之间，我感到她的生理缺陷离她远去，我眼前全是这位美丽的女孩，她的笑容瞬间将我融化，让我对生活有了一个全新的认识。我原本是个贫穷不快乐的大学生，但是她把我带进她的世界，一个充满微笑、爱与温暖的世界。
That was ten years ago. I’m a successful business person now and whenever I get down and think about the troubles of the world, I think about that little girl and the remarkable lesson about life that she taught me.
那是十年前的事了。现在我已经成为一名成功的商人。无论何时，只要我陷入困境，为生活所烦恼时，我都会想起那位小姑娘，想起她给我上的那堂关于人生的不同寻常的一课。
