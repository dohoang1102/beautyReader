These days most people accept that jobs are not for life anymore. People are more mobile and much more likely to change jobs every few years and even careers a number of times throughout their lives. And it is increasingly common that we may also find that we need to change jobs. Having confidence in your skills and experience and your ability to deal with the challenges of starting over can give you a greater sense of confidence about your career, and whatever life brings your way.
Get support. Surround yourself with family and friends and let them know your situation. Stay in contact with those you care about and continue your usual social activities. 
Set up a HQ. Create an environment that is conducive to your job-search project. Set up a basic office at home that includes access to a stationary phone, postage supplies, computer and printer.  
Create an up to date resume. Create a captivating covering letter. Provide a detailed description of the achievements in each of your roles and the timeframes you have been in the role. Provide all contact details including phone number (land line and mobile), email and where possible a fax number. 
Mind your language. Avoid using negative words such as “unemployed”, “on the dole” and “I can’t find a job” and replace them with positive perspectives such as “I will find a job suitable for me”.
Stay well presented. It only takes seven-second to make a first impression. Make the most of your seven-second by smiling when you greet someone. Invest in a good suit; if you don’t have one, borrow one for interviews. Polish your shoes and ensure that your hair is clean and tidy.
